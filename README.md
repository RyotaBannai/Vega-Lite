# Vega-Lite
##### The touching the iceberg of Vega-Lite

** Just for fun learning how it works. The plot outcomes are a disaster w.r.t. overall color choices. 
** (But visually reconiziable to see how each property works and 
     to know where to add them in the json structure)

* Simple Bar Chart

* Circle Natural Disasters
Reference from here. (https://vega.github.io/editor/#/examples/vega-lite/circle_natural_disasters)

(So far)
Pro:
1. Very interactive outcome: we can keep the interactiveness and add a svg file on webpage!
2. Learning carve is high: easy to learn.
3. All parts are easily customizable, and flexible.
4. Online editor makes things much easier(https://vega.github.io/editor/#/edited)

Con:
1. Limiting capacity for users to differentiate the color of each data point.
